***Music*** is the arrangement of sound to create
some +combination+ of __form__, harmony, melody, 
rhythm, or otherwise expressive content.
However, definitions of music vary 
depending on culture, though it is an aspect
of all human societies and a cultural 
universal. While scholars agree that music
is defined by a few specific elements, 
there is no consensus on their precise 
definitions. The creation of music is 
commonly divided into musical composition, 
musical improvisation, and musical 
performance, though the topic itself extends 
into academic disciplines, criticism, 
philosophy, psychology, and therapeutic contexts. Music may be performed using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice to sing, and thus is often credited for its extreme versatility and opportunity for creativity.
